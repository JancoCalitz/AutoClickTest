# AutoClickDetector ‚Äì Intelligent CPS & Pattern Detection Tool  

AutoClickDetector introduces a **smart and adaptive anti-autoclick system** designed for **Paper/Spigot** servers.  
It continuously monitors player click patterns, compares human-like variability, and flags or clears players based on consistent, machine-like behaviour.  

This plugin was built as an experimental and educational tool to explore **statistical pattern detection**, **in-game fairness verification**, and **real-time server analytics**.

---

## Overview  
Upon running the `/autoclick test <player>` command, the system begins analysing the player‚Äôs click sequence over a short interval.  
It records each click‚Äôs timestamp, calculates click-per-second (CPS), and computes **variance and duplication ratios** to determine whether a player‚Äôs input pattern is statistically suspicious.  

The detector applies a custom scoring algorithm that distinguishes legitimate jitter clicking from automated macro or autoclicker input.

## Core Features  

### üîç Real-Time Pattern Analysis  
- Records exact click intervals for the selected player.  
- Calculates **CPS (clicks per second)**, **coefficient of variation**, and **duplicate ratio**.  
- Identifies robotic or highly repetitive patterns (e.g., identical timing across 30+ seconds).  

### üßÆ Statistical Scoring System  
- Uses a weighted detection rule to evaluate:  
  - Low variance with constant intervals ‚Üí suspicious.  
  - Perfectly identical duplicate ratios ‚Üí flagged as autoclicker.  
  - Irregular yet human-like intervals ‚Üí marked as clear.  
- Logs live results in the console for transparency and debugging.  

### ‚öôÔ∏è Configurable Parameters  
- Interval duration, minimum click threshold, and tolerance levels can be adjusted in the configuration file.  
- Designed for iterative testing and threshold fine-tuning during server development.  

### üìä Developer Debug Mode  
- Outputs full raw statistics for each analysed session:  
  - `n` (sample size)  
  - `cps` (clicks per second)  
  - `cv` (coefficient of variation)  
  - `dup` (duplicate ratio)  
- Displays boolean flags for each detection rule (`periodicStrong`, `ruleSuspicious`, etc.)
